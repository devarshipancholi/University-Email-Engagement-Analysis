# University-Email-Engagement-Analysis
During Summer of 2019, me and my team were assigned a project regarding NYU Stern's email-engagement rate. It was basically an open-ended problem with 2 main datasets of about a million observations which analyzed using Alteryx Advance. Once the data was ready to go and cleaned we used R as our statistical analysis software and derived valuable business insights which helped the client to make the Email Engagement process more efficient and cost effective. We improved the conversion rate from prospective students to applicants from 28% to 37% respectively.
